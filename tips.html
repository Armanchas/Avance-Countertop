					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Taste First, Season Second:</span
						>
						It may sound obvious, but you should always taste your
						food before seasoning. If you’re seasoning or marinating
						meat or poultry before cooking, whisk your marinade or
						seasoning blend in a separate bowl for safe tasting
						before adding your protein.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Don’t Pack Your Pan:</span>
						When it comes to stovetop cooking, haste is waste.
						Packing your cooking pan with food will keep the heat
						from distributing evenly, leaving some items raw while
						others may burn. Pick a pan large enough for the job,
						and spread your ingredients in a single layer, making
						sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cooking in smaller
						batches may seem tedious, but ultimately this will speed
						up the process. Visit our Pots and Pans guide for more
						details on the difference between each.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Timing is Subjective:</span>
						While the timing elements found in most recipes can
						serve as a helpful guide, be sure to check your dishes
						by using your own senses. Smell, taste and touch to
						determine doneness, and use a thermometer for meat, fish
						and poultry.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Don’t Believe Everything You Bake:</span
						>
						Each oven has its own unique hot spots, and the
						temperature you set the oven to doesn’t necessarily
						reflect the temperature throughout the oven. To get a
						better idea of your oven’s true temperature, place a
						second thermometer in your oven.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Stop Spinning Your Wheels:</span
						>
						When roasting or grilling, use 2 skewers instead of 1 to
						prevent your food from spinning.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Get Even:</span> For an evenly
						cooked steak, let the meat come to room temperature
						before seasoning and grilling.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Use the Rule of Thumb:</span>
						Learn and practice the rule of thumb to check the
						readiness of steak without cutting into it.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Save Your Starch:</span> Don’t
						rinse pasta after cooking. The remaining layer of starch
						helps sauce adhere to the pasta. Rinsing your pasta will
						cause the sauce to slide, resulting in a bland bite.
						Just starting your sauce? Reserve a cup of the starchy
						pasta water to bring the sauce to life. Visit our Pasta
						guide to learn about different types of pasta.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Use the Wooden Spoon Trick:</span
						>
						Before frying anything in oil, test the oil using a
						wooden spoon. Dip the spoon in and check to see if small
						bubbles appear. Alternatively, you can throw in a few
						small ingredients to test the oil, listening for that
						satisfying sizzle. A low oil temp will cause your
						ingredients to absorb oil and become soggy, rather than
						the oil cooking off the food’s moisture for a crispy
						dish.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Spice Your Food, Not Your Eyes:</span
						>
						When cooking with chili peppers, protect your hands and
						eyes by wearing rubber gloves. Or coat your hands in
						vegetable oil and wash them with soap and water
						immediately after handling.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Make it Joyful and Make it Together:</span
						>
						Homemade meals are good for the heart and soul. Cook
						often and cook with others.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Follow Your Nose:</span>
						Seafood should never smell overwhelmingly fishy; that's
						a sure sign that it’s starting to go bad.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Prioritize Rest:</span> Let
						cooked or grilled meat rest at room temperature before
						serving. This will give the meat time to reabsorb all
						those delicious juices. Here are a few more grilling
						tips to become a grill expert.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Taste Test:</span> Always taste
						your dishes before serving.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Let Your Recipe Be Your Guide:</span
						>
						Recipes are only a guideline. Feel free to substitute
						items that cater to your personal preferences.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Make Your Butter Better:</span>
						To prevent butter from over-browning in your pan, add a
						little bit of lemon juice.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Save Your Spices:</span> Keep
						your spices away from sources of heat like the stove or
						lights. Herbs and spices can lose their flavor when
						exposed to humidity and heat.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Keep Your Crumbs:</span> Save
						old, stale bread to make breadcrumbs in a food
						processor. You can freeze them for up to 6 months.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Embrace Salt:</span> Don’t be
						afraid to use salt. This simple seasoning can pull the
						flavors out of your dishes. Cook with kosher salt and
						season with sea salt.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Skip the Scoop and Slice:</span
						>
						When serving ice cream to large groups, ditch the ice
						cream scoop. Break open the whole container and slice
						the ice cream into perfect portions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Make Your Cheese Grate:</span>
						If you need to grate soft cheeses, freeze the cheese for
						30 minutes for a cleaner slice.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Get the Perfect Poach:</span>
						When poaching an egg, add a teaspoon of white vinegar to
						simmering water to help keep the yolk from breaking.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Preheat Your Pan:</span> When
						sautéing, it’s important to first heat the pan, then
						heat the oil, then add the ingredients.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Boil Smart, Not Hard:</span>
						For a great hardboiled egg, bring your pot to a boil and
						then turn off the heat. Let your eggs sit in the heated
						pot for 12 minutes and then transfer to cold water.
						Visit our step-by-step guide for more tips on the
						perfect hardboiled egg.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Keep it Sunny:</span> Make an
						ideal sunny-side egg by covering your pan with a lid and
						letting the steam cook your egg. No flipping required.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Make Your Own Buttermilk:</span
						>
						If your recipe calls for buttermilk, you can use regular
						milk with lemon juice.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Soak Out Starch:</span> For
						crispy fries or chips, slice the potato, then remove the
						starch by soaking in water for 1 hour before baking.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Buy the Whole Bird:</span>
						Purchasing and preparing a whole chicken is more
						cost-effective than buying specific cuts, and you can
						use the bones to make broth or stock.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Soften Up:</span> To soften
						butter, cut slices into a bowl and let sit at room
						temperature for 10–15 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Make a Vinaigrette:</span> The
						basic ratio to make a classic vinaigrette is 3 parts oil
						to 1 part vinegar.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point"
							>Practice Cool-down Safety:</span
						>
						Help prevent bacteria growth by cooling hot food in a
						shallow dish.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Stock Up:</span> Make stock in
						large quantities and freeze in plastic bags for later
						use.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Make Healthy Swaps:</span> Use
						Greek yogurt as a healthier substitute for mayo, sour
						cream, heavy cream and more.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Finish with Oil:</span> Invest
						in high-quality extra virgin olive oil for special meals
						or to drizzle over dishes to accent flavors.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Seafood? Eat It:</span> Never
						over-season your seafood. Accentuate the flavor of the
						fish with lemon juice, salt and pepper.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Fresh is Best:</span> Look for
						ground beef that has been freshly ground.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tips-point">Go Low and Slow:</span> To
						preserve flavor and prevent burning, it's important to
						cook slow and keep your heat low.
