				<li class="py-5">
					<span class=" underline font-semibold">Taste First, Season Second:</span>
					It may sound obvious, but you should always taste your food
	2				before seasoning. If you’re seasoning or marinating meat or
					poultry before cooking, whisk your marinade or seasoning
					blend in a separate bowl for safe tasting before adding your
					protein.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Don’t Pack Your Pan:</span>
					When it comes to stovetop cooking, haste is waste. Packing
					your cooking pan with food will keep the heat from
					distributing evenly, leaving some items raw while others may
					burn. Pick a pan large enough for the job, and spread your
					ingredients in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd
					the pan. Cooking in smaller batches may seem tedious, but
					ultimately this will speed up the process. Visit our Pots
					and Pans guide for more details on the difference between
					each.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Timing is Subjective:</span>
					While the timing elements found in most recipes can serve as
					a helpful guide, be sure to check your dishes by using your
					own senses. Smell, taste and touch to determine doneness,
					and use a thermometer for meat, fish and poultry.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold"
						>Don’t Believe Everything You Bake:</span
					>
					Each oven has its own unique hot spots, and the temperature
					you set the oven to doesn’t necessarily reflect the
					temperature throughout the oven. To get a better idea of
					your oven’s true temperature, place a second thermometer in
					your oven.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Stop Spinning Your Wheels:</span>
					When roasting or grilling, use 2 skewers instead of 1 to
					prevent your food from spinning.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Get Even:</span> For an evenly
					cooked steak, let the meat come to room temperature before
					seasoning and grilling.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Use the Rule of Thumb:</span>
					Learn and practice the rule of thumb to check the readiness
					of steak without cutting into it.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Save Your Starch:</span> Don’t
					rinse pasta after cooking. The remaining layer of starch
					helps sauce adhere to the pasta. Rinsing your pasta will
					cause the sauce to slide, resulting in a bland bite. Just
					starting your sauce? Reserve a cup of the starchy pasta
					water to bring the sauce to life. Visit our Pasta guide to
					learn about different types of pasta.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Use the Wooden Spoon Trick:</span>
					Before frying anything in oil, test the oil using a wooden
					spoon. Dip the spoon in and check to see if small bubbles
					appear. Alternatively, you can throw in a few small
					ingredients to test the oil, listening for that satisfying
					sizzle. A low oil temp will cause your ingredients to absorb
					oil and become soggy, rather than the oil cooking off the
					food’s moisture for a crispy dish.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold"
						>Spice Your Food, Not Your Eyes:</span
					>
					When cooking with chili peppers, protect your hands and eyes
					by wearing rubber gloves. Or coat your hands in vegetable
					oil and wash them with soap and water immediately after
					handling.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold"
						>Make it Joyful and Make it Together:</span
					>
					Homemade meals are good for the heart and soul. Cook often
					and cook with others.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Follow Your Nose:</span>
					Seafood should never smell overwhelmingly fishy; that's a
					sure sign that it’s starting to go bad.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Prioritize Rest:</span> Let cooked
					or grilled meat rest at room temperature before serving.
					This will give the meat time to reabsorb all those delicious
					juices. Here are a few more grilling tips to become a grill
					expert.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Taste Test:</span> Always taste
					your dishes before serving.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold"
						>Let Your Recipe Be Your Guide:</span
					>
					Recipes are only a guideline. Feel free to substitute items
					that cater to your personal preferences.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Make Your Butter Better:</span>
					To prevent butter from over-browning in your pan, add a
					little bit of lemon juice.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Save Your Spices:</span> Keep your

				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Keep Your Crumbs:</span> Save old,
					stale bread to make breadcrumbs in a food processor. You can
					freeze them for up to 6 months.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Embrace Salt:</span> Don’t be
					afraid to use salt. This simple seasoning can pull the
					flavors out of your dishes. Cook with kosher salt and season
					with sea salt.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Skip the Scoop and Slice:</span>
					When serving ice cream to large groups, ditch the ice cream
					scoop. Break open the whole container and slice the ice
					cream into perfect portions.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Make Your Cheese Grate:</span>
					If you need to grate soft cheeses, freeze the cheese for 30
					minutes for a cleaner slice.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Get the Perfect Poach:</span>
					When poaching an egg, add a teaspoon of white vinegar to
					simmering water to help keep the yolk from breaking.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Preheat Your Pan:</span> When
					sautéing, it’s important to first heat the pan, then heat
					the oil, then add the ingredients.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Boil Smart, Not Hard:</span>
					For a great hardboiled egg, bring your pot to a boil and
					then turn off the heat. Let your eggs sit in the heated pot
					for 12 minutes and then transfer to cold water. Visit our
					step-by-step guide for more tips on the perfect hardboiled
					egg.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Keep it Sunny:</span> Make an ideal
					sunny-side egg by covering your pan with a lid and letting
					the steam cook your egg. No flipping required.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Make Your Own Buttermilk:</span>
					If your recipe calls for buttermilk, you can use regular
					milk with lemon juice.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Soak Out Starch:</span> For crispy
					fries or chips, slice the potato, then remove the starch by
					soaking in water for 1 hour before baking.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Buy the Whole Bird:</span>
					Purchasing and preparing a whole chicken is more
					cost-effective than buying specific cuts, and you can use
					the bones to make broth or stock.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Soften Up:</span> To soften butter,
					cut slices into a bowl and let sit at room temperature for
					10–15 minutes.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">

					large quantities and freeze in plastic bags for later use.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Make Healthy Swaps:</span> Use
					Greek yogurt as a healthier substitute for mayo, sour cream,
					heavy cream and more.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Finish with Oil:</span> Invest in
					high-quality extra virgin olive oil for special meals or to
					drizzle over dishes to accent flavors.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Seafood? Eat It:</span> Never
					over-season your seafood. Accentuate the flavor of the fish
					with lemon juice, salt and pepper.
				</li>
				<li class="py-5">
					<span class="underline font-semibold">Fresh is Best:</span> Look for
					ground beef that has been freshly ground.
